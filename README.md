# MathSolverAI
the code for the part of the team project that I contributed.
so, I've a part of the code to solve the math problems, but I wouldn't upload the code cuz I didn't contribute this part.
so, you could only see own my part about DL and dataset maker code.
but I would havbe uploaded the code that you could test about the DL.
you could see the presentation pdf in documents file.
